# Two Pointer

**Tell:** Items in the list must be in **sorted** orde&#x72;**.** The array should be already-sorted or the question should not be asking for index (i.e. you can sort to find the answer values)

_Pointers_ when solving two-pointer questions:

1. Usually I use `while pointer2 < pointer1` to loop through the array
2. Two-pointers approach generally decrease the space complexity to `O(1)` - so try this on array questions when asked to use constant space.&#x20;



Classic Problems:

1. 2Sum
2.  3Sum:&#x20;

    Problem: Find all 3-number subsets in array where a+b+c=0

    Solution: Loop through array for a + do 2Sum for b and c
