# Monotonic Stack

Monotonic stacks are a good option when a problem involves comparing the size of numeric elements, with their order being relevant.

If we need to pop **smaller** elements from the stack before pushing a new element, the stack is **decreasing** from bottom to top. Otherwise, it's **increasing** from bottom to top.

1. Basic Monotonic Question [https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/) :orange\_circle:

Ordering/Indexing is taken care by the order in which elements go in the stack. Magnitude and comparing values is done by making the stack monotonic.&#x20;
