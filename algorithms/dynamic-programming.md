# Dynamic Programming

Characteristics:

* #### **Overlapping Subproblem**s <a href="#overlapping-subproblems" id="overlapping-subproblems"></a>
*   #### Optimal Substructure Property <a href="#optimal-substructure-property" id="optimal-substructure-property"></a>



Dynamic Programming Methods

* #### Top-down with Memoization <a href="#top-down-with-memoization" id="top-down-with-memoization"></a>
* #### Bottom-up with Tabulation <a href="#bottom-up-with-tabulation" id="bottom-up-with-tabulation"></a>

How To approach a Dynamic Programming Problem In Interview:

* Identify the Pattern and type of Problem
* Identify the Base Cases
* Create a Recursive Solution and check for Overlapping Sub Problems
* Check for changing Parameters and Store the subproblems in a Table
